<h3>Odd, Even and Prime numbers</h3>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This project consists code that helps in finding Odd & Even numbers and Prime numbers from the array given.
It has two files included named "app.js" and "index.js". "index.js" file has code that helps to find Odd and Even numbers from the given array where "app.js" file has code to identify prime numbers out of the given array. After finding Prime numbers again one variable created called 'primeArray' for finding the Bigger prime number and smaller prime number also the sum of all prime numbers.</p>
<h4>Answer to code</h4>
<p>For index.js file: Even numbers: 2, 20, 14, 12, 8, 6, 4, 10, 16, 18</p>
<p>                   Odd numbers: 3, 7, 15, 9, 5, 1, 11, 19, 17, 13</p>
<p>For app.js file: Prime number: 19, 23, 13, 31, 29, 11, 17, 5</p>
<p>                 Minimum Value: 5</p>
<p>                 Maximum Value: 31</p>
<p>                 Sum of Prime numbers: 148</p>

<h4>Expected Output</h4>
<p>For index.js file: Even numbers: 2, 20, 14, 12, 8, 6, 4, 10, 16, 18</p>
<p>                   Odd numbers: 3, 7, 15, 9, 5, 1, 11, 19, 17, 13</p>
<p>For app.js file: Prime number: 19, 23, 13, 31, 29, 11, 17, 5</p>
<p>                 Minimum Value: 5</p>
<p>                 Maximum Value: 31</p>
